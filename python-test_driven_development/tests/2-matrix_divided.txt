The ``2-matrix_divided`` module
============================

Using ``matrix_divided``
---------------------

First import the function from the module:
    >>> matrix_divided = __import__('2-matrix_divided').matrix_divided

Now test regular division:
    >>> matrix = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]
    >>> matrix_divided(matrix, 4)
    [[0.25, 0.5, 0.75], [1.0, 1.25, 1.5]]

Test that original matrix is unchanged:
    >>> matrix
    [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]

Test division by 2:
    >>> matrix = [[2, 4, 6], [8, 10, 12]]
    >>> matrix_divided(matrix, 2)
    [[1.0, 2.0, 3.0], [4.0, 5.0, 6.0]]

Test division with negative numbers:
    >>> matrix = [[-1, -2, -3], [-4, -5, -6]]
    >>> matrix_divided(matrix, 2)
    [[-0.5, -1.0, -1.5], [-2.0, -2.5, -3.0]]

Test division with floats:
    >>> matrix = [[1.5, 2.5, 3.5], [4.5, 5.5, 6.5]]
    >>> matrix_divided(matrix, 2)
    [[0.75, 1.25, 1.75], [2.25, 2.75, 3.25]]

Test division by negative number:
    >>> matrix = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]
    >>> matrix_divided(matrix, -3)
    [[-0.33, -0.67, -1.0], [-1.33, -1.67, -2.0]]

Test empty matrix:
    >>> matrix = []
    >>> matrix_divided(matrix, 2)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    TypeError: matrix must be a matrix (list of lists) of integers/floats

Test matrix with wrong type:
    >>> matrix = "not a matrix"
    >>> matrix_divided(matrix, 2)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    TypeError: matrix must be a matrix (list of lists) of integers/floats

Test matrix with rows of different sizes:
    >>> matrix = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5]]
    >>> matrix_divided(matrix, 2)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    TypeError: Each row of the matrix must have the same size

Test division by zero:
    >>> matrix = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]
    >>> matrix_divided(matrix, 0)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ZeroDivisionError: division by zero

Test division by non-number:
    >>> matrix = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]
    >>> matrix_divided(matrix, "2")
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    TypeError: div must be a number

Test matrix with non-numbers:
    >>> matrix = [[1, "2", 3], [4, 5, 6]]
    >>> matrix_divided(matrix, 2)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    TypeError: matrix must be a matrix (list of lists) of integers/floats
